## Browser incompatibility

When people are using your website, they’re likely using it through one of many browser
extensions. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari are just a few of the most
popular browsers. As such, websites need to be compatible with all of the major types of
browsers in order to ensure good user experience across the board. Without instituting
compatibility testing, however, you may not be able to catch bugs that only appear in certain
browsers.

## Validation fields

[x] If you enter invalid characters into your validation fields, or exceed the maximum length, then
errors and bugs can easily crop up. These bugs are extremely common and typically not that
severe, but there are a few that can truly make or break your software.

## Date control

[-] If your site or app requires age restrictions (such as with dating apps or websites for alcoholic
beverages), there are often bugs related to date control. These are most commonly found in
the registration forms where people are inputting their birth date. Why? Because developers
often only test for the exact cut-off date, when in reality you have to test for the dates
immediately preceding and following the cut-off date.

## Crashes caused by button clicks

Chances are you’ve experienced a time where you’ve clicked on just one button and suddenly
the entire app crashes. These hidden time-bombs are extremely common but difficult to weed
out by developers. With software testing, though, you’ll be able to spot and correct these bugs
far more easily than you would

# Communication errors

If your software is not “user-friendly,” that’s a problem. Anything that your user needs to know
in order to use your app should be accessible on the screen. Keep in mind the importance of
having a useful menu on the homepage as well as a “help” section and make sure it is clear to
your user why he or she should use your app.
